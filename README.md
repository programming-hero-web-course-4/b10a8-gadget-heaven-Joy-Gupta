This project employs several core React concepts, including:

- **Components**: Each part of the application is organized into reusable components.
- **JSX**: JSX syntax is used to define the UI structure.
- **Props**: Data is passed between components using props to create dynamic and reusable components.
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage state and side effects within components.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used for navigating between different pages of the app without reloading.

## Data Handling and Management
